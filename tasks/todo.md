## Review
- Added `docs/plans/2026-03-09-m5-2-1-telegram-client-design.md` and `docs/plans/2026-03-09-m5-2-1-telegram-client.md` to pin the milestone scope before implementation.
- Replaced the Telegram placeholder with an async `TelegramClient` that supports injected HTTP transport and minimal `get_updates()` polling.
- Added `tests/infra/im/test_telegram.py` covering success, request params, Telegram error payload mapping, and malformed response handling.
- Verification passed: `.venv/bin/pytest -o addopts='' tests/infra/im/test_feishu.py tests/infra/im/test_telegram.py -q`, `.venv/bin/pytest -o addopts='' -q`, `.venv/bin/ruff check .`.
- Refreshed `.venv` with `.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"` before final regression because the environment was missing declared dependency `croniter`.
- Commit completed in this session: `feat(im): complete M5.2.1 telegram client skeleton`.
